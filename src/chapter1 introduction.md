# Introduction
Life before and after the _Arrival_ is the same.
The alien spacecrafts appear out of nowhere and disappear in the same way.
They do not bring any scientific or technologic insight, but a message that relieves those who comprehend it of their fear for the future.

The message is given in the climax of the movie, when a revelation causes the protagonist, as well as the viewer, to reinterpret everything before it.
It simultaneously reveals to both, how the protagonist's life will unfold.
This aligns the viewer's experience with that of the protagonist, both having gained awareness of an inevitable future, the death of the protagonist's yet unconceived child.
This knowledge takes away the ability to impact the outcome, thus stripping both, the viewer and the protagonist, of their free will.

However the gravity of this revelation is very different.
For the viewer this merely means loosing the suspense of an open ending where they can decide for themselves which of the tragic choices the protagonist takes.
For Louise, the protagonist, the consequences are of a much more fundamental nature, best explained by analyzing the different facets of _Arrival_ [@arrival].

The setup of _Arrival_ is that of a classical invasion movie.
Traditionally this setting is used as a background for fast-paced action and military conflict.
Its earliest example, H. G. Wells' _The War of the Worlds_ from 1898 [@war-of-worlds], already portrays aggressive aliens invading Earth.
The idea most likely stems from British imperialism and a time when most western European nations had colonies in Africa.
In the work, the purpose of the aliens' invasion of Earth is that of the colonists' invasion of Africa:
Harvesting resources and exploiting people.

Besides several movie and TV series adaptions, _The War of the Worlds_ also inspired many other works in its genre.
Therefore, aliens are commonly portrayed as hostile invaders, for example in titles such as _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_ (1956), _They Live_ (1988), _Independence Day_ (1996), _Mars Attacks_ (1996), _Edge of Tomorrow_ (2014) or _A Quiet Place_ (2018) [@bodysnatcher; @theylive; @independenceday; @marsattacks; @edge; @quietplace].
Oftentimes the aggressors are given a hive mind form, stripping them of their individuality and any relatable human features, reducing them to nothing but an antipathic opponent for the protagonists.

_Arrival_ plays with this trope of hostile aliens.
Louise Banks, a renowned linguist, and Ian Donnelly, an acclaimed physicist, are tasked by the US military with uncovering the intentions behind the aliens' visit to Earth.
In order to answer the central question of "Why are they here?", they have to learn how to communicate with the aliens.
After making progress and building some common vocabulary with the aliens, they are pressured by the military to prematurely ask the question to the aliens.
The answer is ambiguous, due to lack of knowledge about the alien's language.
Its ambiguity creates military tension, especially since other alien landing sites, of which there are twelve in total, got similar answers and now plan on attacking the intruders.
But instead of presenting the viewer with a feast of action scenes, explosions and the armies of the world fighting off the invaders, _Arrival_ lets its protagonist Louise resolve the crisis through communication.

The prologue shows a montage of the short life of Hannah, Louise's daughter.
She dies at a very young age, leaving Louise in a state of sorrow.
While Louise studies Heptapod, as the alien language is called, she has what appears to be flashbacks to her time with Hannah.
When Louise heads back to the spacecraft to try and resolve the ambiguity of the aliens' answer, she is transported inside.
One of the aliens explains to her, that through learning the Heptapod language Louise started experiencing time non-linearly.
This reveals to Louise and the viewer that all the apparent flashbacks, including the prologue, really were visions of the future.

With the ending of the movie now set, the finale bridges the story points.
Through Ian's help Louise has learnt that the aliens want mankind to work together and that each landing site received one piece of a puzzle.
All the pieces put together form the gift the aliens want to give to the people of Earth, their language.
Louise, now knowing about her capabilities, manages to find a phone that can make calls out of the lockdown, which is imposed on the military facility that she is in.
Through her ability to have visions of the future she knows the number of a seemingly hostile military leader, and also what she has to say, to prevent him from taking military action against the alien spacecrafts.

With the tension resolved, the spacecrafts leave as if it was what they were waiting for.
More visions reveal that Ian and Louise end up together.
Ian also turns out to be Hannah's father, who, as shown throughout previous visions, ends up separating from Louise.
He does so because Louise tells him that she knows about Hannah's early death through visions.
Ian disagrees with Louise, blaming her for making the wrong choice to have Hannah, despite knowing how short her life will be.

In the following it is discussed if this accusation of making a wrong choice is justified, by analyzing the depiction of free will in _Arrival_.
Chapter 2 lays the groundwork for this by examining how the movie focuses on its characters' emotions throughout the story.
Chapter 3 then focuses on communication, _Arrival_'s central theme that weaves together all story elements.
In chapter 4 the two previous points are compared with the effects of the Heptapod language to show how the movie portrays free will.
It also discusses the aforementioned accusation.
Chapter 5 concludes with a brief summary of how _Arrival_ uses the deterministic nature of movies for its narrative structure.
