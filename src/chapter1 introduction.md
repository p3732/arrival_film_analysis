# Introduction
The twist at the ending of ___Arrival___ not only causes the viewer to reinterpret everything before it, but also lets the viewer know the ending of the story.
This aligns the viewer's experience with that of the protagonist.
Both have gained knowledge of an inevitable future, the death of the protagonist's unconceived child.
This knowledge takes away the ability to impact the outcome, thus stripping both, the viewer and the protagonist, of their Free Will.

However the gravity of this revelation is very different.
For the viewer this merely means loosing the suspense of an open ending where they would have to decide for themselves which of the tragic choices the protagonist takes.
For Louise, the protagonist, the consequences are of a much more fundamental nature, best explained by analyzing the different facets of ___Arrival___.

The setup of ___Arrival___ is that of a classical invasion movie.
Traditionally this setting is used as a background for fast-paced action and military conflict.
Its earliest example, H. G. Wells' ___The War of the Worlds___ from 1898,
<!--TODO reference-->
already portrays aggressive aliens invading earth.
The idea most likely stems from British imperialism and a time when most 'western' European nations had colonies in Africa.
In the work, the purpose of the alien invasion of Earth is that of the colonists invasion of Africa:
Harvesting resources and exploiting people.

Besides several movie and TV series adaptions, ___The War of the Worlds___ also inspired many other works.
Because of this, aliens are commonly portrayed as hostile invaders, for example in titles such as ___The Day the Earth Stood Still___ (1951), ___They Live___ (1988), ___Independence Day___ (1996), ___Mars Attacks___ (2011), ___Edge of Tomorrow___ (2014) or ___A Quiet Place___ (2018).
Oftentimes the aggressors are given a hive mind form, stripping them of their individuality and any relatable human features, reducing them to nothing but an antipathic opponent for the protagonists.

___Arrival___ plays with this trope of hostile aliens.
Louise Banks, a renowned linguist, and Ian Donnelly, a well-received physicist, are tasked by the US military with uncovering the intentions behind the aliens' visit to earth.
In order to answer the central question of "Why are they here?", they have to learn how to communicate with the aliens.
After making progress and building some common vocabulary with the aliens, they are pressured by the military to prematurely ask the question to the aliens.
The answer is ambiguous, due to lack of knowledge about the alien's language.
Its ambiguity creates military tension, especially since other alien landing sites, of which there is twelve in total, got similarly uncertain answers and now plan on attacking the intruders.
But instead of presenting the viewer with a feast of action scenes, explosions and the armies of the world fighting off the invaders, ___Arrival___ lets its protagonist Louise resolve the crisis through communication.

The prologue showed a montage of the short life of Hannah, Louise's daughter.
She dies at the very young age of 12, leaving Louise in a state of sorrow.
While Louise studies Heptapod, as the alien language is called, she has what appears to be flashbacks to her time with Hannah.
When Louise heads back to the spacecraft to try and resolve the ambiguity of the aliens' answer, she is transported inside.
One of the aliens explains to her, that through learning the Heptapod language Louise started experiencing time non-linearly.
This reveals to Louise and the viewer that all the apparent flashbacks, including the prologue, really were visions of the future.

With the ending of the movie now set, the finale bridges the story points.
Through Ian's help Louise has learnt that the aliens want mankind to work together and that each landing site received one piece of a puzzle.
All the pieces put together form the gift the aliens meant to give to the people of earth, a description of their language.
Louise, now knowing about her capabilities, manages to find a phone that can make calls out of the lockdown, which is imposed on the military facility that she is in.
Through future visions she knows the number of the main antagonist, a Chinese military leader, and also what she has to say, to prevent him from taking military action against the alien spacecrafts.

With the tension resolved, the spacecrafts leave as if it was what they were waiting for.
More visions reveal that Ian and Louise end up together.
Ian also turns out to be Hannah's father, who, as shown throughout previous visions, ends up breaking up with Louise.
He does so because Louise tells him that she knows about Hannah's early death through visions.
Ian disagrees with Louise, blaming her for making the wrong choice to have a baby despite knowing how short Hannah will live.

In the following it is discussed if this accusation of making a wrong choice is justified and what it reveals about the depiction of Free Will in ___Arrival___.
Chapter 2 lays the groundwork by examining how throughout its story ___Arrival___ focuses on emotions of its characters.
Chapter 3 focuses on communication, the movie's central theme.
In chapter 4 the two previous points are compared with the effects of the Heptapod language to see how ___Arrival___ portrays Free Will.
It also discusses the aforementioned accusation.
Chapter 5 concludes by analyzing how ___Arrival___ uses the deterministic nature of movies for its narrative structure.
