# Conclusion
"No other art can fix time except cinema. So film is the mosaic of time."
_Arrival_ uses its ability to fix time, as Andrei Tarkovsky describes the process of movie making [@time], to tell its emotional story in a way, that almost unifies the protagonist and the viewer.
Both simultaneously learn that they already know the ending of the story, robbing them of the possibility to just walk away and shut their eyes from the future.

The cover of this seminar thesis features a visualization of _Arrival_'s "mosaic of time", a logogram that in a clockwise order contains all flashforwards placed as they occur during the movie.
The logogram also starts and ends in the same position, a theme heavily used in the movie.
Examples include the name Hannah, the chronological end and beginning of the story being so alike that they are shown in direct succession and the prologue and the epilogue opening with the same shot of Louise's ominous window.

The story of _Arrival_ explores many different topics, such as 'fake news', fear of the unknown and free will, but it does so in a natural way with the feelings and emotions of the characters always being valid and relatable.
The movie ends with the protagonist embracing the inevitable and not fearing the future anymore.
Throughout the movie the protagonist and the viewer are set up the same way.
Just like _Arrival_ mirrors the arrival depicted in itself, what if the protagonist also mirrors the viewer?
The description from the beginning still holds valid:

Life before and after the _Arrival_ is the same.
The alien spacecrafts appear out of nowhere and disappear in the same way.
They do not bring any scientific or technologic insight, but a message that relieves those who comprehend it of their fear for the future.
