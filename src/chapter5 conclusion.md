# Conclusion
"No other art can fix time except cinema. So film is the mosaic of time."
_Arrival_ uses its ability to fix time, as Andrei Tarkovsky describes the process of movie making [@time], to tell its emotional story in a way, that almost unifies the protagonist and the viewer.
Both simultaneously learn that they already know the ending of the story, robbing them of the possibility to just walk away and shut their eyes from the future.
<!--Both simultaneously perceive the time jumps and both don't understand them, as the viewer is mislead by a Kuleshov effect, and only clued in on the truth at the same time as the protagonist.-->

The cover of this seminar thesis features a visualization of _Arrival_'s "mosaic of time", a logogram that in a clockwise order contains all flashforwards placed according to the time they occur in during the movie.
The logogram also starts and ends in the same position, a theme heavily used by the movie, as for example in the name of Hannah, the prologue and the epilogue opening with the same shot of Louise's ominous window and the ending of the story being so alike, they are shown in direct succession one after the other.

The story of _Arrival_ explores many topics, such as 'fake news', fear of the unknown and free will, but it does so in a natural way with the feelings and emotions of the characters always being valid and accessible.
The movie ends with the protagonist embracing the inevitable and not fearing the future anymore.
Throughout the movie the protagonist and the viewer are set up the same way.
As _Arrival_ also mirrors the Arrival depicted in itself, what if the viewer actually were the protagonist?
The description from the beginning still holds valid for this meta layer:

Life before and after the _Arrival_ is the same.
The alien spacecrafts appear out of nowhere and disappear the same way.
They don't bring any scientific or technologic insight, but a message, that relieves those who understand it of their fear for the future.
