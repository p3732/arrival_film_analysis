# Communication
In 1977 mankind launched the Voyager Golden Records, an effort to share a broad picture of humans and life on earth with extraterrestrials.
These records might be the most famous nonfictional attempt at communicating with aliens.
The compilation of the records' contents was supervised by astrophysicist Carl Sagan, who later went on to write the source material for the 1997 movie _Contact_.
In reviews it is often named as a reference for _Arrival_, as they have many parallels:
both have a strong female lead, both are calm and intelligent counterexamples to classic action-driven 'hostile aliens' movies and, most obviously, both revolve around the theme of communication.

In _Arrival_ this theme is reflected upon in several ways.
With the protagonist, Louise, set to safe the world by using her capabilities as a linguist, many problems that need to be resolved by her are bound to revolve around communication.
The core problems of the Sci-Fi narrative can be attributed to three different issues of miscommunication:
The central plot drive, the landing of the aliens and Louise's quest to uncover their intentions, leads to an ambiguous answer, which causes a __misinterpretation__ of the aliens intentions.
The nations, having previously overcome their language barriers to cooperate and exchange information on the aliens, are lead by to __mistrust__ each other by this apparent threat.
The third problem stays in the background throughout most of the movie and can best be described by its modern term, __'fake news'__, resulting in a violent attack against the peaceful alien visitors.

The __misinterpretation__ of the aliens' message "Offer weapon" is quite clearly caused by a language barrier.
Much like its counterpart, the real barrier existing between Louise and the visitors, it stems from a fundamental difference between humans and aliens.
Not only do the aliens need a different composition of atmosphere to breathe, they also are portrayed to live lives greatly distinctive to those of humans.
While Louise, Ian and the military crew stand on their side with a vastness of technology and protective hazard suits, the Heptapods are just there, without any tools or utilities.
The only 'technology' that they seem to have, are the big pebble-shaped spaceships they came in, which by comparison with classic depictions of UFOs in other works of science fiction, don't have a particular technological feel to them either.
Instead the spaceships, as well as their navigators, appear mysterious.
This was very well intended according to director Villeneuve, who wanted the aliens to have a "strong instinctive presence" much like a whale or an elephant [@interview-villeneuve] (at 5:15).

So from the perspective of the aliens, offering a 'weapon' could have a clearly defined meaning, since their language apparently is the only tool they posses.
It is even foreshadowed that this 'weapon' is language, when Ian is introduced and reads the preface of Louise's book, quoting her that language "is the first weapon drawn in a conflict".

The military has an equally limited perspective.
From the get go it is suspicious of the aliens intentions, even fearing the atmosphere in the spaceship, in which humans are able to breath, is a trap to eventually suffocate sent messengers.
The army also restricts Louise to only using a predefined list of words, in fear that if given too much knowledge about mankind, the aliens could abuse that information.
Quite possibly this lack of vocabulary lead to the ambiguity of the received message "offer weapon", which promptly is interpreted as many things, from a demand to be offered a weapon by humans, to the starting signal for a _Battle Royale_ [@battle_royale] among the different nations of earth.

With the military's __mistrust__ fired up across all landing sites, the established international communication comes to a halt.
The used setup of communication via video telephony shows insight into the importance of using multiple communication channels.
It allows for facial expressions and gestures to aid in overcoming the language barrier, instead of limiting communication to audio or even text.

Thus it seems surprising that the nations abruptly stop communication, as, much like the famous idea attributed to Paul Watzlawick, "One cannot not communicate".
A blocked channel clearly states the loss of trust in the other party.
Since the army is afraid of a retaliation by the aliens, not communicating with other befriended nations would be a bad idea.
Even in a scenario where the aliens plan to rile up the nations into waging war against each other, a blockage of communication does not pose any advantage[^nuclear].
However, it can be argued that on an emotional level such a reaction is very likely, as the uncertainty of this strange, never before existing situation can lead to anything.
Especially when the public is panicked and the people making the decisions are pressured into a reaction.

Indeed it is shown at several points that the public is panicked about the arrival of the spaceships.
The subplot involving Captain Marks and several military secondary characters is strongly related to this.
In an attempt to kill the invaders, Marks launches an unauthorized offensive, placing a bomb inside the spaceship.
This causes the only violent action scenes of the movie: the explosion of the bomb, killing one of the aliens and endangering Louise and Ian, and the off-screen shooting of the rebelling soldiers.

How Marks and his men got to the point of despair that led them to these actions, can be seen in short scenes scattered across the story.
Shown media coverage of the spaceship landings is often speculative and sensational, fueling public hysteria.
Presumably shaken up by such reports, Marks' partner calls in hysteria, telling him who she is scared, while he has troubles calming her down.
Marks himself looks very unnerved during the scenes in the alien spaceship and notably wants to quit the session when Louise takes off her hazard suit.
But the longest scene that hints at the later fallout features Marks and another soldier watching a __'fake news'__ broadcast show.

The show parallels _The Alex Jones Show_ in many ways, picking up on elements such as the aggressive undertone, an unstoppable rage against the government and strong pro-gun views.
The actor of the show host also bares a strong resemblance to the real life host.
The video stream is surrounded by advertisements, mostly for guns, another on point caricature, as most such websites operate by using the traffic they generate with 'fake news' to create money through advertisements[^shop], leading to notable income (as the BBC reports in an interview [@bbc-fake]).
The snippet of the show ends with a call to arms against the aliens, over which Marks and his comrade exchange affirmative glances.
Instead of merely sharing the show with others, one of the major issues that helps the vicious circle of 'fake news' to continue [@ieee], Marks follows through on the propagated preemptive strike against the aliens.

This sociopolitical commentary, that was true back in 2016 during the movie's theatrical release, can still be applied to current day time.
During the 2019/2020 Corona virus crisis [^crisis], 'fake news' were still a major problem [@corona-fake].
Comparing the depiction of 1950s society in _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ with nowadays society depicted in _Arrival_, their reactions are not all that different.
The invaders are still met with fear, which is amplified by the sensationalism of the media and the global connectivity of the internet.
Director Denis Villeneuve comments that "civilization is more fragile than ever" and that despite being more connected, it seems that mankind actually communicates less [@interview-villeneuve] (at 15:31).

Unlike in _The Day the Earth Stood Still_, the story of _Arrival_ has Louise resolve the tension caused by the miscommunication.
After having several visions of the future, in which Louise always appears confused, at some point asking Hanna what day it is, she slowly learns that she can interact with the visions.
This is fully revealed to her by a vision of Hannah wanting to know a specific term.
Having just heard the term, non-zero sum game, in the present, she reenters the vision and is thus able to answer Hannah's question.
When she has a vision of an elevator descending from the spaceship, she instinctively acts upon it, enabling her to learn about the aliens reasons to come to earth.

Now Louise has all required capabilities to overcome all of three previously discussed communication issues:
She overcame the language barrier with the aliens and so can come to a __correct interpretation__ of their intentions.
By combining her newly acquired skills of the Heptapod language with her knowledge of the Mandarin language, she is able to to obtain the number of General Shang, and gain his __trust__ by appealing to his emotions.
She manages to change his mind and convinces him of peace and __collaboration__.

The words Louise speaks to Shang are not actually subtitled, but according to Heisserer, who wrote their English counterpart, translate to "In war there are no winners, only widows." [@widows].
A simple wisdom that resolves all previous tension and aggression, bringing the movie's Sci-Fi story to a conclusion.

[^nuclear]: As concluded from the Cold War, considering the amount of nuclear weapons existing in the world, there would not be any winners anyway.
[^shop]: Either that or selling overpriced goods that can't hold up to their claimed effectiveness.
[^crisis]: An epidemic can somewhat be seen as an invasion, just not by aliens but by viruses.
