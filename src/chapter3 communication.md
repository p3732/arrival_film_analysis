# Communication
In 1977 mankind launched the Voyager Golden Records, an effort to share a broad picture of humans and life on earth with extraterrestrials.
These records might be the most famous nonfictional attempt at communicating with aliens.
The compilation of the records' contents was supervised by astrophysicist Carl Sagan, who later went on to write the source material for the 1997 movie _Contact_.
In reviews it is often named as a reference for _Arrival_, as they have many parallels:
both have a strong female lead, both are calm and intelligent counterexamples to classic action-driven 'hostile aliens' movies and, most notably, both revolve around the theme of communication.

In _Arrival_ this theme is reflected upon in several ways.
With the protagonist, Louise, being a linguist set to save the world using her academic expertise, many problems that need to be resolved by her are bound to revolve around communication.
The core problems of the Sci-Fi narrative can be attributed to three different issues of miscommunication.

The central plot drive is the landing of the aliens and Louise's quest to uncover their intentions.
Due to pressure by the army, Louise is forced to ask the central question of "Why are you here?" prematurely.
As Louise describes it, the aliens' answer "Offer weapon" is ambiguous, as the shared vocabulary is very limited,.
A __misinterpretation__ of the aliens intentions by the nations around the globe, leads to a situation where an attack against the aliens seems imminent.
The nations, having previously overcome their language barriers to cooperate and exchange information on the aliens, start to to __mistrust__ each other because of unclear positions and fear of retaliation by the aliens.
The third communication problem stays in the background throughout most of the movie and can best be described by its modern term, __'fake news'__, resulting in an attack against the peaceful alien visitors.

The __misinterpretation__ of the aliens' message  is quite clearly caused by a language barrier.
Much like its counterpart, the physical barrier existing between Louise and the visitors, it most likely stems from a fundamental difference between humans and aliens.
Not only do the aliens need a different composition of atmosphere to breathe, they also are portrayed to live lives greatly distinct to human lives.
While Louise, Ian and the military crew stand on their side with a vastness of technology and protective hazard suits, the Heptapods are just there, without any tools or utilities.
The only 'technology' that they seem to have, are the big pebble-shaped spaceships they came in, which by comparison with classic depictions of UFOs in other works of science fiction, don't have a particular technological feel to them either.
Instead the spaceships, as well as their navigators, appear mysterious.
This was very well intended according to director Villeneuve, who wanted the aliens to have a "strong instinctive presence" much like a whale or an elephant [@interview-villeneuve] (at 5:15).

So from the perspective of the aliens, offering a 'weapon' could have a clearly defined meaning, since their language apparently is the only tool they posses.
It is even foreshadowed that this 'weapon' is language, when Ian is introduced and reads the preface of Louise's book, quoting her that language "is the first weapon drawn in a conflict".

The military has an equally limited perspective.
From the get go it is suspicious of the aliens intentions, even fearing the atmosphere in the spaceship, in which humans are able to breath, is a trap to eventually suffocate sent messengers.
The army also restricts Louise to only using a predefined list of words, in fear that if given too much knowledge about mankind, the aliens could abuse that information.
It is quite possible that this lack of vocabulary led to the ambiguity of the received message "offer weapon", which the different nations of earth promptly interpreted to mean many things, ranging from a demand to be offered a weapon by humans, to the starting signal for a global _Battle Royale_ [@battle_royale] among all nations.

With the military's __mistrust__ fired up across all landing sites, the established international communication via video telephony comes to a halt.
The used setup of communication allowed for facial expressions and gestures to aid in overcoming the language barrier.
It shows that the military has insight into the importance of using multiple communication channels, and knows not to limit communication to audio or text feeds.

Thus it seems surprising that the nations abruptly stop communication, as, much like the famous idea attributed to Paul Watzlawick, "One cannot not communicate".
A blocked channel clearly states the loss of trust in the other party.
Since the army is afraid of a retaliation by the aliens, not communicating with other befriended nations would be disadvantageous.
Even in a scenario where the aliens plan to rile up the nations into waging war against each other, a blockage of communication does not pose any advantage[^nuclear].
However, it can be argued that on an emotional level such a reaction is very likely, as the uncertainty of this strange, never before existing situation can lead to anything.
Especially when the public is panicked and the people making the decisions are pressured into a reaction.

Indeed it is shown at several points that the public is panicked about the arrival of the spaceships.
The subplot involving Captain Marks, and several minor characters of the military, is strongly related to this.
In an attempt to kill the invaders, Marks launches an unauthorized offensive by placing a bomb inside the spaceship.
This causes the only violent action scenes of the movie: the explosion of the bomb, killing one of the aliens and endangering Louise and Ian, and the off-screen shooting of the rebelling soldiers.

How Marks and his men got to the point of despair that led them to these actions, can be seen in short scenes scattered across the story.
Shown media coverage of the spaceship landings is often speculative and sensational, fueling public hysteria.
Presumably shaken up by such reports, Marks' partner calls him, telling him how she is scared and distressed and he has trouble calming her down.
Later on, Marks himself looks very unnerved during the scenes in the alien spaceship and notably wants to quit the session when Louise takes off her hazard suit.
But the most striking scene that hints at the later fallout features Marks and another soldier watching a __'fake news'__ broadcast show.

The show parallels _The Alex Jones Show_ in many ways, picking up on elements such as the aggressive undertone, an unstoppable rage against the government and strong pro-gun views.
The actor of the show host also bares a strong resemblance to the real life host.
The video stream is surrounded by advertisements, mostly for guns, another on point caricature, as most such websites operate by using the traffic they generate with 'fake news' to make money through advertisements[^shop], leading to high income for little effort [@bbc-fake].
The snippet of the show ends with a call to arms against the aliens, over which Marks and his comrade exchange affirmative glances.
Instead of merely sharing the show with others, which would already be problematic enough and one of the major issues that helps the vicious circle of 'fake news' to continue [@ieee], Marks follows through on the propagated preemptive strike against the aliens.

Comparing the depiction of 1950s society in _The Day the Earth Stood Still_ with nowadays society depicted in _Arrival_, their reactions are not actually all that different though.
In both the invaders are met with fear and in both movies an action of the aliens is misinterpreted by a soldier, causing tension.
The key difference however is the reason for the aggression.
The 1950s military tries (and fails) to make short work of the aliens mere minutes after they arrived, because a nervous soldier shots the alien when it made an unexpected move.
In _Arrival_, when captain Marks starts an attack against the aliens, this is not really caused by a misinterpretation of the alien's actions, but due to a heavily biased world view.
The possible reasons for this are manifold, but the movie shows that the sensationalism of the media, the global connectivity via the internet and the simplicity with which false information can be created and shared, certainly are influences.

This sociopolitical commentary, that was just as true back in 2016 during the movie's theatrical release, can still be applied to current day time.
During the 2019/2020 Corona virus epidemic[^crisis], 'fake news' were still a major problem [@corona-fake].
Director Denis Villeneuve comments that "civilization is more fragile than ever" and that despite being more connected, it seems that mankind actually communicates less [@interview-villeneuve] (at 15:31).
But unlike in _The Day the Earth Stood Still_, where the aliens leave earth with a threat, _Arrival_ ends on a more optimistic note in relation to intergalactic affairs.

In the beginning Louise is very confused by her visions, in one of them even asking Hannah what day it is.
As she becomes more familiar with the Heptapod language, the visions become more frequent.
She slowly learns that she can interact with the visions, which is fully revealed to her by a vision of Hannah wanting to know a specific term.
After hearing the described term, 'non-zero sum game', in the present, she reenters the vision and thus is able to answer Hannah's question.
When she has a vision of an elevator descending from the spaceship, she instinctively acts upon it and approaches the envisioned location.
Inside the spaceship she then learns about the aliens actual reasons to come to earth.

Now Louise has all required capabilities to overcome all of the three previously discussed communication issues:
She overcame the language barrier with the aliens and so can come to a __correct interpretation__ of their intentions.
By combining her newly acquired skills of the Heptapod language with her knowledge of the Mandarin language, she is able to to obtain the number of the general Shang.
He is in charge of the Chinese military and has declared war against the aliens.
Louise appeals to Shang's emotions, by repeating the last words of his deceased wife back at him, which she simultaneously learns in a vision.
Having hereby gained the general's __trust__, Louise manages to change his mind and convinces him of peace and __collaboration__.

The words Louise speaks to Shang are not actually subtitled, but according to Heisserer, who wrote their English counterpart, translate to "In war there are no winners, only widows." [@widows].
A simple wisdom that resolves all previous tension and aggression, bringing the movie's Sci-Fi story to a conclusion.

[^nuclear]: The conclusion of the Cold War: There would not be any winners in a world with the amount of currently existing nuclear weapons.
[^shop]: Or in case of _The Alex Jones Show_ selling overpriced goods that can't hold up to their claimed effects.
[^crisis]: An epidemic can somewhat be seen as an invasion, just not by aliens but by viruses.
