# Emotions
_Arrival_ is based on the short story _Story of Your Life_ by Ted Chiang [@soyl] which is told solely from the point of view of the protagonist, Louise.
The movie adaptation follows suit by closely following Louise and featuring her in almost every scene.
The camera commonly focuses on Louise, often as a reaction shot, or follows her gaze from a third-person perspective, making the viewer see most things from her perspective.
This is especially true for all scenes involving Hannah.

## The Absence of Technology
The relationship between Louise and her daughter is "the heart of movie", as director Denis Villeneuve puts it [@interview-villeneuve, at 08:16].
It is the counterweight to the Sci-Fi part of the movie and makes the story feel more relatable and quite literally 'down to earth'.
Villeneuve therefore describes _Arrival_ as a "dirty Sci-Fi" movie, that tries to realistically depict the events, so that it feels like they could happen "on a bad Tuesday morning". [@interview-villeneuve, at 09:03]
To follow along with this realism the movie does not use any technology that does not already exist today.[^scripts]

_Arrival_ hereby follows in the steps of _Solaris_ [@solaris], which was Andrei Tarkovsky counterexample to Stanely Kubrick's _2001: A Space Odyseey_ [@2001].
Tarkovsky states that Kubrick's movie relies too heavily on technology and thus lacks compassion and emotions.
Or as Tarkovsky phrases it himself: "the technological processes of the future transforms the emotional foundation of a film, as a work of art, into a lifeless schema" [@solaris-interview].

Much like _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_ by Steven Spielberg [@encounters], named as an influence by screenwriter Eric Heisserer [@interview-heisserer, at 23:58], _Arrival_ follows Tarkovsky vision and focuses on relatable human lives and emotions.
On multiple occasions throughout the movie scenes with potential for dramatic action are skipped entirely or postponed to a later point.
This not only allows for buildup of tension, but also enables scenes to focus on characters' emotions and reactions.

An example is the scene in which Louise first learns of the alien landings.
Only reactions of Louise and her class are shown, providing the viewer merely with emotional information on what is happening, but no insight on the ongoing event itself.
Another example is the first encounter.
After a brief introduction of the aliens it is cut short to Ian and Louise being in the disinfection tent afterwards, recovering and processing their experience.

## The Kuleshov Effect
However, the perceived emotions are not always accurate.
During most of the movie, the viewer is mislead to see Louise as a grieving mother.
This is achieved by using the Kuleshov effect.
The effect describes how a viewer's perception of a scene is altered by its context.
For example, if a shot of a person with a neutral facial expression is cut to a shot of a person in a coffin and then is cut back to the same person with the same neutral facial expression, the viewer will interpret the person to be sad.
If the same is done with a plate of food instead, the person will be interpreted as hungry. [@kuleshov]

At the end of the prologue a grief-stricken Louise walks away from Hannah's death bed.
The scene fades out and is followed by a match cut to present-day Louise walking in the same direction.
By composing these scenes together in this way, the viewer perceives the scenes as being connected.
Due to the Kuleshov effect, the viewer thinks of Louise as a sad person that has lived through her daughters death, concluding that the prologue is the backstory for Louise's character.
Accordingly all perception of further scenes with Hannah are equally perceived as flashbacks, making Louise appear to be in mourning rather than having inexplicable visions.

## The Appeal of the Unknown {#twothree}
In reality Louise simply is a calm person, that leads a rather mundane, uneventful life.
Actress Amy Adams describes her character as having "a profound loneliness" [@interview-amy-denis, at 12:20].
And indeed she is lonely, as she, with a bit of sadness in her voice, reveals to Ian that she never had any real romantic relationships, despite her communication skills.

During the evacuation of the campus Louise stays undisturbed, while others are shaken up enough to crash their cars.
Even on the day after the arrival of the spaceships, as if nothing changed, she returns to an otherwise empty university.
What is perceived as grief could just be signs of loneliness, as indicate by a scene of Louise sleeping with a body pillow.
Louise's calm character is displayed at the very beginning, when she walks by a big crowd of people gathering around a TV, determined to get to her teaching class.

But despite soothing her mother on the phone, saying she should stay composed like her, Louise is visibly interested in the alien landings.
She spends the day watching the news, even falls asleep to them.
When Colonel Weber considers recruiting Louise as a linguist for the army, she succeeds in convincing Weber to pick her over another candidate.

Thus the viewer gets to follow Louise on her journey to meet the unknown.
Arriving at the military base, where the camera closely follows Louise through the hallways, she gets prepared for meeting the aliens.
The sound of loud breathing when in the hazard suite gives a sense of involvement and proximity to the viewer, as do the closeups of Ian and Louise touching the strangely shaped spaceship for the first time.

## The Light {#twofour}
During the encounters with the aliens, light is used as a metaphor for familiarity, while its absence is accordingly used for the opposite, the unknown.
The spaceships are thus dark, with an equally dark tunnel leading upwards into their inner sanctuary.
In contrast to this darkness, the familiar faces of the human task force are lit up by the lamps built into the hazard suits [^helmets], which also allows to read the characters facial expressions and thus emotions.
At the end of the tunnel is a big, bright white barrier, separating humans and aliens.
Its shape parallels that of the big window front in Louise's studio apartment, that is prominently featured in the opening shot and subsequent shots later on.
Maybe this familiar shape is what leads Louise to build up enough trust and take of her helmet during the third encounter [^third], resulting in the first actual successful communication.

However, when the aliens arrive for the first time, the familiar, white barrier is shrouded in darkness and fog.
The aliens are not fully visible, blurring out into mist, as if their mysterious aura is clouding the light.
Only later, after Louise dares to step into a completely dark monolithic elevator and is transported to the other side of the barrier, the full shape of the aliens can be seen.
There, beyond the barrier, the fog allows a white blinding ambient light to shine through.
It is also there that Louise has her revelation, now understanding the capabilities that the Heptapod language gives her.

This understanding is visualized through the metaphor of light:
In a vision Louise is standing in her apartment.
The background consists of the wide window front, which is closed off by a curtain.
She looks at the shining ceiling lamp, the only source of light in the scene.
As the camera simultaneously pans and moves from behind Louise towards her front, Louise turns from being a mere shadow to being illuminated.
She is now familiar with the Heptapod language, the visions no longer appear to her as coming from an unknown source.
But the closed curtain symbolizes that she will not receive any more help from the aliens, she is on her own now.
