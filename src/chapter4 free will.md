# Free Will
"Man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills."
This statement attributed to Arthur Schopenhauer is but one of many views that have been expressed on free will.
With the Heptapod language enabling its speaker to see the future, _Arrival_ also touches on the subject.
How can there be free will, if the future is inevitable and determined?

## The Mind
The answer given in the original short story, _Story of Your Life_, can be classified as a compatabilist one, dismissing neither free will, nor determinism.
Instead it states that these are simply two sides of the same coin: "freedom is not meaningful, but neither is coercion" [@soyl, p. 33].
Since the Heptapods have a different perception of time, they have no concept of causation and consequently no need for free will.
When learning the Heptapod language, Louise transforms from having a "sequential consciousness" to a "simultaneous consciousness" and thus loses her free will.
Becoming just like the aliens, she does not possess the ability to share her knowledge of the future with anyone.

_Arrival_ clearly deviates from its source material on this matter, as Ian and Louise break up precisely because Louise tells Ian about Hannah's grim future.
Screenwriter Eric Heisserer comments, that he did not want the same deterministic setup and wrote Louise to have "a little more control over that space" [@interview-heisserer, at 6:10].
He wanted Louise to be able to make choices, which is why she can interact with the visions.
But despite Heisserer stating that he believes that Louise "did change some things" [@interview-heisserer, at 5:00], all those changes did not alter anything, as the visions are fixed events guaranteed to happen in the future.
They therefore behave like the predictions made by the Oracle of Delphi in classic Greek stories.

If the visions are the predictions, then the Heptapod language must function as the oracle itself.
But how is such an oracle supposed to work, let alone how is a language supposed to induce such a way of thinking?
Taking a step back will help in finding a perspective.

The human mind and its inner workings have been described in many ways throughout history.
The current scientific point of view has uncovered much of the functionality of the human brain, from biochemical processes, to localizing different brain activity functions in certain cerebral areas.
But a definite description of how the mind works and how consciousness is created in it, still does not exist.

Many see AI, artificial intelligence, as a possible approach to learning how to create consciousness.
The possible connection has long sparked interest in the arts to reflect upon it.
Popularity of works such as Spielberg's _A.I. Artificial Intelligence_ (2001) [@ai] or current day's TV series _Westworld_ (2016-ongoing) [@westworld], reflect a broad interest in the topic.
The computer game _The Talos Principle_ (2014) [@talos], which has a strong focus on free will in AIs, draws its inspiration from the story of Talos, an ancient Greek mythological figure.
Created by the gods for the sole purpose of protecting an island, Talos was a conscious robot, which shows how old the idea of conscious machines is.

In an interview on his involvement with _Arrival_, Stephen Wolfram compares extraterrestrial communication with communication with AI.
"They're both cases where we're dealing with an intelligence that doesn't have the same historical lineage that ours does." [@wolfram].
So looking at ways that AIs think in, can help to understand how a human mind altered by an alien language could think.

Unfortunately the most common current forms of 'AI' are simple neural networks.
They are still far from having any sort of consciousness and are only capable of 'learning' on the basis of training sets.
The information received by the training sets is memorized, 'learnt', and can be used to later process new information in the light of the previously created processing structure.

This structure is the way in which neural networks 'think' and it can be observed via visualization techniques.
These have existed since 2015 [@deepdream] and are commonplace by now, even popularized with user-friendly interfaces such as `deepart.io` [@deepart].
The graphical results they produce are a strange sight to behold.
They usually are a mixture of noise and recognizable elements woven into it, giving them a psychedelic, dreamlike aesthetic.

So if even the 'thought processes' of such comparatively simple mechanisms already have such complex patterns, then surely the ways in which a human brain can work, with its approximately 100 billion neurons and millions of years of evolutionary refining, are not all that limited.
Still there are historic reasons for the human brains working the way it does.
Maybe the passing of time and the principle of causation are just 'programmed' into a human brain, much like into any animal, because such thinking posed an evolutionary advantage?

## The Heptapod Language
The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, as it is referred to in the movie, also known as the hypothesis of language relativity, states that the language a human speaks, to at least some extent, shapes how that human thinks.
Like _Story of Your Life_, _Arrival_ uses this hypothesis to argue that learning a radically new language, like the alien Heptapod, can change the patterns in a human brain so drastically, that a different perception of reality is possible, even while still being confined to the same 'hardware', the same neuron-based brain.

Changing the brain's perception of reality is not the interesting part though, as similar experiences can be experienced through intensive meditation or psychedelics.
The main difference is that Louise's brain, by simply subconsciously processing and learning the Heptapod language, already produces visions of the future.
This is supported by the scene in which Louise is so sleep-deprived that the visions mix with the reality of the present.
The weariness causes her to hallucinate and see one of the aliens standing in front of her in the military camp, foreshadowing a later scene where the alien actually does stand right in front of her.
When Louise is rested, the visions don't mix with the present, but she still goes into a state of transcendence during them and acts in the envisioned future as if it was happening in the present.

Jessica Coon, a linguist professor who was involved with _Arrival_ as a consultant, states: "As linguists, we are very skeptical of this idea that your thought processes could be radically altered or determined by learning another human language." [@interview-linguists, at 13:34].
However, Coon would not strictly rule out the possibility that an alien language vastly different enough from any human language, could use the mind in a completely new way, requiring a radically different way of thinking.
She points out though, that for such a language to have any impact on Louise, it would have "to be similar enough or understandable enough that she is able to learn it." [@interview-linguists, at 12:28].

Heptapod attempts to be 'alien' and fundamentaly different from existing human languages, both in its appearance, using logograms for whole sentences, and in the way it functions.
According to director Villeneuve, the production team created a foundation of basic vocabulary for Heptapod and a guide on "how the words are constructed" [@interview-villeneuve, at 12:40], so there actually are comprehensible rules for the language.
Professor Coon, who was tasked with annotating and trying to translate some of the produced logograms, summarizes that the language "is art" [@interview-coon].
The logograms circular form fits the recurring theme of circles, which is scattered throughout the whole story.

Overall _Arrival_'s concept of an alien language that drastically alters its speaker's perception of the world is not too far-fetched.
However, for this to impact the perception of time as strongly as depicted, needs an assumption that time is not a fixed property of the metaphysical world.
The movie makes this assumption, wherefore the concept of the Heptapod language and it's influence works coherently in-universe.
But what implications does this have for the characters' free wills?

## The Choices
The following is an analysis of how and on what basis characters make decisions during the story and whether they act the way they do because of free will or because they are determined to.
As what lead captain Marks to make the decision of placing a bomb inside the spaceship has already extensively been dealt with in the previous chapter, the remaining three major choices to be investigated are:

* The Heptapod's choice to come to earth.

* Ian's choice to leave Louise.

* Louise's choice to have Hannah.

### Abbott and Costello
Ian nicknames the two aliens, Abbott and Costello, after the American comedy duo.
The names are another example of foreshadowing, as the duo is most famous for their _Who's on first sketch?_ routine [@whosonfirst], which revolves all around miscommunication, much like the message received by the aliens, 'Offer Weapon', is misinterpreted by the army.

Not much is known about the alien visitors' intentions until Louise meets Costello alone, Abbott having died from the bomb attack.
There they reveal that their mission is to give mankind the gift that is their language.
In the movie the reason is given as "In three thousand years - we need humanity help".
The final shooting draft of the script contains a different phrasing of this scene, more fitting with the timeless way in which the aliens think, but it was probably cut due to length.
There Costello replies with "Three thousand years from this point, humanity helps us. We help humanity now. Returning the favor." [@script, p. 102].

The reason the aliens are on earth, is thus simply because it is necessary for history to play out the way it will.
They need to travel to earth, so that the people of earth can in return help them 3000 years in the future.
Or the other way round, since mankind helps them, they need to help mankind 3000 years before that.
Much like in the short story, the aliens in the movie adaption don't have any sort of free will and no need for it either.
They merely act like pawns, enacting the history they know will happen.

A good example of this is the last encounter with Abbott.
Louise is encouraged to draw a logogram on the barrier, but since it at that point she still has a linear perception of time, she can only draw it starting from one side.
Abbott steps in and, without Louise ever stating what she intends to draw, completes the other half of the logogram.
A further example is, how the aliens move their spaceship in the exactly right moment.
When Louise suggests going back to the spaceship and apologize for the attack, it moves at precisely that moment.
In the same way the spaceships leave earth at the very instant that the military tension is resolved.
Yet another, albeit darker, example of this is Abbott knowing of their death, but having no way of preventing it.

### Louise and Hannah
As [previously](#twothree) discussed, before Louise got hired to communicate with aliens, she led a very fearful and mundane life.
By learning the Heptapod language Louise breaks with her fear of the future, and "despite knowing the journey and where it leads", embraces and welcomes "every moment of it".
With Ian and Hannah she will finally be loved and feel alive, things that she is deeply missing in her current life.
As the famous quote by Alfred Tennyson goes, "'tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all" and thus for Louise Hannah's death is by far outweighed by all the happy times to come.

<!--This can be seen as another reason as to why Louise wants to have Hannah.-->
<!--Hannah is portrayed as a happy kid, energetic, emotional and creative.-->
<!--All these traits make her the exact opposite of the Heptapods, who are shown as plain, boring and emotionless beings, without any cultural objects or garnishments.-->
<!--If having visions of the future made the aliens into what they are, then Louise might now value Hannah's spontaneity and creativity even more.-->

But even if Louise embraces her future with Hannah, her choice merely 'coincide' with the determined future.
At no point was there the possibility to decide against having Hannah, so it can not be said that Louise acted upon free will, but the reason for the future to be determined in the way that it is, is due to her will.
Hence her future might be determined, but it is determined by her will.
Thus she seems to only partly behave like a Heptapod, as she is enacting history the way she wants it to happen.

So much like the quote of Schopenhauer from the beginning of this chapter, Louise can not will what she wills, but she can still will.
And as the outcome is the same, the answer to the question of whether free will exists in _Arrival_ or not, is no, this does not have any impact on the characters, as their 'simulated' free will is all they need.

### Ian and Louise
Through her visions Louise knows that Ian will eventually break up with her.
She also knows the reason, which will be that she tells Ian about knowing of Hannah dying at a young age.
As Louise tells Ian that she has the knowledge from a vision, he knows that Louise did in fact not have a choice, as the vision simultaneously is the source of information as well as a guarantee that it will happen.
And yet he blames Louise for having made the wrong choice.
This error in logic is very obvious, so assuming it is not simply a plot hole, then why does Ian react this way?

Louise is an introverted linguist, knowledgeable about communication and other cultures, able to speak several languages including Farsi and Mandarin.
Ian on the other hand is portrayed as an outgoing physicist, experienced in sciences, especially maths and theoretical physics.
From the first time they met, Louise and Ian are an unlikely couple.
Indeed the first words they exchange are over whether science or language is the foundation of society.

When accusing Louise of having, the wrong choice, Ian does not need to regard whether free will exists.
The choice that he disagrees with was still made by Louise, it just so happens that she knew beforehand that she was going to make it.
And just like the knowledge about living in a deterministic world does not change anything about the responsibility for choices, neither does it change the validity of feelings.
And Ian's choice to leave Louise is as fueled by emotions, as are the choice of captain Marks to attack the spaceships or that of Louise to have Hannah.
All these choices might be determined, but they all are deeply human.
